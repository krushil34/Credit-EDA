# Loan Default Risk Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Introduction
This project aims to analyze loan application data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing loan default. The insights will help financial institutions minimize risk by making informed lending decisions.

## Objective
Understand patterns that indicate a client's likelihood of defaulting on a loan.
Identify significant variables affecting loan repayment behavior.
Provide actionable insights to optimize loan approval decisions.

## Dataset Description
The project utilizes three datasets:

application_data.csv – Information about loan applicants at the time of application.
previous_application.csv – Details of previous loan applications (status: Approved, Refused, etc.).
columns_description.csv – Data dictionary describing variable meanings.
EDA Approach
Data Understanding & Cleaning

Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Convert categorical data to meaningful formats.

## Data Exploration

Analyze distributions of key variables.
Identify correlations between variables.
Compare default vs. non-default groups.
Insights & Key Findings

Determine which attributes strongly predict default risk.
Provide recommendations for risk mitigation.
Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
